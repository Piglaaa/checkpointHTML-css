                <h3>Cristiano Ronaldo</h3>
                <p>Cristiano Ronaldo is arguably one of soccer’s all-time greatest players. He is the game’s highest scorer on record and has been a super athlete from the beginning, when an 18-year-old Ronaldo became “the most expensive teenager in British football history” after Manchester United paid roughly $15 million for his transfer to the team. Currently a free agent, he was reportedly offered a $207 million-per-year deal by Saudi Arabian club Al Nassr FC.</p>

                            <p>After working out for about 2 hours, Ronaldo takes a nap for around an hour and a half. At 9:30 am, he fuels up with breakfast, which typically consists of high-protein foods, such as ham, cheese, and yogurt, as well as a glass of fruit juice. At about 10:30 am, he does another 2-hour workout session.</p>
